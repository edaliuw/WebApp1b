# WebApp1b (Working Title: Bracketdocious, an awful name but I couldn't think of anything "marketable")

The initial upload of code includes some controllers with existing entities. The next step is to connect teams to both matches and brackets using migrations. 
Beyond this, there is also a need to connect program logic to the views in order to display a table. 

To narrow the scope of the project, tournaments will only be single elimination. No Double Elimination or Block based brackets. Also, there won't be any settings for Round Robin play.
